# COVID-19-Project
This project is a COVID-19 statistics dashboard based on real data from HDX (The Humanitarian Data Exchange. Novel Coronavirus cases Data),
NYTimes. COVID19 Data, and DataHub.Novel Coronavirus 2019
2 csv files are provided that are collected from the sources mentioned below. 
First csv file is: "full_data.csv" which includes dated numbers of cases and deaths per country.
Second csv file is: "locations.csv", which includes list of countries and their corresponding continent. 
This code provides a statistic board with the following data: 
1. Total coronavirus cases in each continent. (Both from lowest to highest and highest to lowest)
2. Total coronavirus deaths in each continent. (Both from lowest to highest and highest to lowest)
3. Prioritizes top countries for testing based on new cases per million.
